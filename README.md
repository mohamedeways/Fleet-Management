2. Dashboard Overview
The Fleet Dashboard is divided into several sections, each providing critical insights into different aspects of fleet management.
Sections:
•	Fleet Overview: A high-level view of the entire fleet, showing the total number of vehicles, their current operational status, and overall fleet health.
•	Fuel Efficiency: Displays data on fuel consumption across the fleet, cost per mile, and comparisons over time.
•	Maintenance Tracker: Shows maintenance schedules, overdue services, and upcoming tasks.
•	Vehicle Utilization: Provides insights into vehicle usage, idle time, and mileage.
•	Cost Analysis: Breaks down expenses related to the fleet, including maintenance costs, fuel expenses, and other operational costs.
